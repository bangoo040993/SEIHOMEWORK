3.BN The Code is a tic-tac-toe game. It have two players represented by X and O. The Board hold empty arrays with null and when click it put in a value that correspond with the COMBOS which is the winning condition. Each player take turn clicking the boxex. It check the winning condition through a checkWinner() function that irates over the wining COMBOS array. After each player turn it update the message to display the state of the gamethrough a renderboard() function.
 - code does well in organization and commented out additional method. easy to understand clean and precise. 
 - there is a constant variable that check the win count for each players O and X but it does not display in the element. If Sapana can update the win count when the board is render each time it is being reset. 
 - i noticed there wasnt a buttonevent when the game is tie. you should add one .
 - THank you for letting me code review you Sapana!!!
 - the code review are commented in the javascript file!
